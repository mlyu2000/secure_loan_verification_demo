"""SLVD demo assistant — a scoped assistant that answers questions about this demo.

Primary path: a full LLM call (same OpenAI-compatible endpoint the memo agent
uses) with the demo knowledge base + real case fixtures as context, so answers
are natural, phrasing-independent, and grounded in the actual demo data.

Fallback path (LLM unavailable: offline tests / SLVD_SIMULATION / no API key /
timeout): a deterministic rule-based intent matcher so the demo always answers.

# ---------- knowledge base (demo facts only) ----------

WHAT = """SLVD (Secure Loan Verification Demo) shows a governed, human-in-the-loop AI
workflow for loan renewal. An AI agent researches a case by pulling credit data
from the bank's back-office systems and drafts a decision memo. A senior credit
officer then makes the final approve/reject call on large or risky cases.
Every step is recorded in an audit trail.

In one line: the AI does the analyst's research in minutes, but a human always
holds the approval pen — and every action is on the record."""

HOW = """The end-to-end flow:
1. Client (Acme) asks to renew a $5M facility.
2. Analyst (Nick) starts the case with the case id + amount.
3. AI agent pulls data from 5 governed systems: CRM, credit exposure,
   transactions, compliance (KYC/sanctions), prior memo.
4. AI drafts the credit decision memo.
5. Policy gate — if amount >= $5M or KYC is pending, it escalates to an
   approver (smaller/clean cases auto-complete).
6. Approver (Sarah) reviews and decides (console or email link).
7. Memo is published to the official credit record.
8. Client is notified by email.

The 10 tracked steps: Identity validated -> Case resolved -> CRM -> Credit exposure ->
Transactions -> Compliance -> Prior memo -> Draft memo -> Submission -> Approval decision."""

COMPONENTS = """Core components (Kubernetes namespace 'slvd', 4 pods):
- Portal — React + TS UI: analyst console, approver governance console, mail inbox.
- Workflow Engine — FastAPI (Python 3.11). The system of record: the 10-step
  pipeline, the policy gate, JWT auth (analyst vs approver), the audit trail, the
  mailer, and the gated publish.
- credit-memo-mcp — a governed MCP server. 5 read tools + 1 gated submit
  (the memo cannot be published until an approval is recorded).
- Data Store — SQLite + files on a PVC: runs, audit, draft/official memos.
- Mailpit — in-cluster SMTP sink + UI for approval/client email.

AI layer:
- OpenClaw agent (NemoClaw, ns 'nemoclaw') — the generative step; it pulls data
  via the bank-credit skill and drafts the memo.
- litellm-helm -> qwen3-8-27b (ns 'project-user-aieadmin') — LLM inference.

Note: llama3.1-8b is NOT supported here — its output does not fit the accepted
schema in OpenClaw, so the agent loop breaks. We use qwen3-8-27b."""

WHY_BOTH = """We keep a FastAPI engine AND an OpenClaw agent because an LLM agent is
not a trustworthy system of record:
- FastAPI = the compliance system — deterministic, unit-testable. It owns
  state, identity, the policy gate, the gated submit, the audit trail, and all
  human integration (portal, console, emails, archive).
- OpenClaw = the analyst's brain — the visible "agentic" drafting step. It is
  a pluggable backend (SLVD_AGENT_BACKEND = openclaw | direct_llm | stub); swap
  it and the whole governance layer is unchanged.
- The agent cannot bypass control — the submit tool is gated server-side, and
  the agent's draft is validated before it proceeds. The memo only publishes after
  a human approval is recorded."""

POLICY = """Approval policy: a case requires senior approval if
amount >= $5,000,000 OR KYC status is pending (the default threshold is $5M).
Everything else can auto-complete. This mirrors the video: the $5M Acme renewal
crosses the threshold (and its KYC is pending), so it escalates to the approver.
The rule is enforced by the engine (code), not by the model — the AI cannot decide
when a human is required."""

ROLES = """Roles:
- Client — Acme Industrial (CL-77821). Requests the renewal; receives the
  decision by email.
- Analyst — Nick Johnson (E102938). Starts the case and states the amount.
  Never approves anything.
- AI Agent — credit-memo-agent. Collects data from 5 systems and drafts the
  memo. Never invents a number; never makes the final call.
- Approver — Sarah Chen (E200145). Senior credit officer; makes the final
  approve/reject decision on large/risky cases."""

TOOLS = """The governed MCP tools (called in order):
1. get_crm_profile — client profile, industry, beneficial-ownership status
2. get_credit_exposure — facility, limit, utilization, risk rating, covenants
3. get_transactions — transaction / cash-flow behavior
4. get_compliance_status — KYC status + sanctions
5. get_prior_memo — prior conditions, open follow-ups
6. workflow__submit_credit_memo — submits the memo (GATED: needs approval)

The first five are read-only and authorized per-case (x-user-id). The sixth is
blocked until a human approval is recorded in the engine."""

VALUES = """Why the demo matters:
- Governance — AI prepares the work; a human makes the call. No AI decision is
  final on its own.
- Accuracy — every figure comes from a governed bank-system call; memos are
  validated before submission.
- Auditability — who did what, when, and why is recorded; the approval is logged
  under the approver's identity; the official memo is archived per case/year.
- Efficiency — the agent fetches and drafts in minutes, not days; the approver
  reviews a ready memo; the client is notified the moment a decision lands."""

CASES = """Sample cases in the demo:
- CR-2026-00451 — Acme Industrial Holdings (CL-77821), $5M renewal. Crosses the
  $5M threshold and KYC is pending -> requires approver sign-off. Expected: Approve
  with conditions.
- CR-2026-00452 — Blue Harbor Logistics, $2M, clean (no approval rule triggered)
  -> auto-completes.
- CR-2026-00453 — $2M, KYC pending -> requires approval (KYC rule)."""
