# SLVD — Secure Loan Verification Demo

A **governed, human-in-the-loop AI workflow** for loan renewal. A replication of marketing video [Human‑Guided AI: Secure Loan Verification on HPE Private Cloud AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFZFVrltDX0). An AI agent gathers
credit data from the bank's back-office systems and drafts a decision memo; a senior
credit officer makes the final call on large or risky cases. Every step is audited.

> **The story in one line:** the AI does the analyst's research work in minutes, but a
> human always holds the approval pen — and every action is on the record.

## How it works (business view)

A client (Acme Industrial) asks to renew a **$5M** revolving facility. The bank's
analyst (Nick) starts the case. From there:

1. **Client requests** a renewal of the facility.
2. **Analyst submits** the case id and the requested amount.
3. **AI agent pulls data** from five bank systems — CRM profile, credit exposure,
   transaction behavior, compliance (KYC/sanctions), and the prior memo.
4. **AI drafts the memo** — a professional credit decision memo (recommendation + conditions).
5. **Policy gate** — if the amount is **≥ $5M** *or* KYC is **pending**, the case is escalated
   to a senior approver. (Smaller, clean cases can auto-complete.)
6. **Approver reviews & decides** — Sarah Chen, senior credit officer, approves or rejects
   from a governance console (or by clicking the link in her approval email).
7. **Memo is published** to the official credit record.
8. **Client is notified** by email with the outcome.

### The demo end-to-end (screenshots from a live PCAI run)

Captured from a real run on the deployed demo (case `CR-2026-00451`, $5M renewal):

1. **The agent's `bank-credit` skill** — shipped by the NemoClaw chart and seeded into the
   gateway at pod start. The OpenClaw dashboard's Skills page lists it as *installed* and
   *eligible*; this is what turns the generic gateway into the governed credit analyst.

   ![NemoClaw skills page](images/nemoclaw-skills-bank-credit.png)

2. **Sign in as the analyst** — the portal login screen shows the demo credentials;
   `nick / analyst123` (Risk Analyst) and `sarah / officer123` (Senior Credit Officer)
   get different consoles, matching their roles.

   ![Portal login](images/portal-login.png)

3. **Nick starts the governed run** — he picks the case, states the amount, and clicks
   *Generate renewal decision memo*. The agent pulls the five bank systems via the
   governed MCP, drafts the memo, and the run reaches the **policy gate**
   (amount ≥ $5M + KYC pending) — it pauses here, and a signed approval email goes to Sarah:

   ![Run paused at the policy gate](images/nick-run-paused-at-gate.png)

4. **Sarah approves from her Governance Console** — the queue entry shows the case,
   the policy trigger, and the request timestamp; her decision is recorded under her
   identity (E200145) in the audit trail:

   ![Approval console](images/sarah-approval-console.png)

5. **The approval email in the mailbox** — Mailpit (the in-cluster SMTP sink,
   `https://slvd-mail.${DOMAIN_NAME}`) holds the `[ACTION REQUIRED]` email sent to
   `Sarah.Chen@mybank.com`: policy reasons, the case summary table, and a signed
   deep-link to record the decision from the email itself.

   ![Approval email in Mailpit](images/approval-email-mailpit.png)

6. **Nick's run completes — memo published** — after Sarah's decision the paused run
   auto-continues: every workflow step is checked, the memo is published to the official
   record (`/official/credit/2026/CR-2026-00451`), the decision summary names the
   approver, and the client receives the outcome email:

### Who does what

| Role | Who | What they do | What they do **not** do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Client** | Acme Industrial (CL-77821) | Requests the renewal; receives the decision by email | — |
| **Analyst** | Nick Johnson (E102938) | Starts the case, states the amount | Never approves anything |
| **AI Agent** | credit-memo-agent | Collects data from 5 systems, drafts the memo | Never invents a number; never makes the final call |
| **Approver** | Sarah Chen (E200145) | Makes the final approve/reject decision on large/risky cases | — |

### Why it matters

- **Governance** — AI prepares the work; a human makes the call. No AI decision is final
  on its own.
- **Accuracy** — every figure comes from a governed bank-system call. The agent is only
  allowed to cite real data; memos are validated before submission.
- **Auditability** — who did what, when, and why is recorded. The approval is logged under
  the approver's identity. The official memo is archived per case/year.
- **Efficiency** — the agent fetches and drafts in minutes, not days. The approver reviews a
  ready memo, not raw data. The client is notified the moment a decision lands.

## Architecture

### Technical overview

The system runs on **HPE Private Cloud AI (PCAI)** as pods in a dedicated Kubernetes
namespace (`slvd`), with the AI agent and the LLM as separate in-cluster services whose
endpoints are configured via chart values.

![Technical architecture](images/slvd-technical-architecture.png)

**Core components:**

| Component | Tech | Port | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Portal** | React + TS (nginx) | 80 | Analyst UI, approver console, mail inbox |
| **Workflow Engine** | FastAPI (Python 3.11) | 8080 | The governed pipeline, policy gate, JWT auth, audit, mailer |
| **credit-memo-mcp** | MCP server (JSON-RPC) | 8000 | Governed data tools + the gated submit tool |
| **Data Store** | SQLite + files on PVC | — | Runs, audit trail, draft/official memos |
| **Mailpit** | SMTP + UI | 1025 / 8025 | Approval + client email (in-cluster sink) |

**AI layer:**

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **OpenClaw agent** (NemoClaw) | The generative step — pulls data via the `bank-credit` skill and drafts the memo |
| **LLM endpoint** — LiteLLM proxy *or* MLIS-served model | LLM inference (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`) |

**LLM endpoint — LiteLLM is not a must.** The engine and the agent talk standard OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions`, so any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works: the in-cluster **LiteLLM proxy** *or* a
model served directly by **MLIS** (`https://<model>.<namespace>.serving.<platform-domain>/v1`). Point
`SLVD_LLM_BASE_URL` and `SLVD_LLM_MODEL` at the endpoint; when using MLIS, set `SLVD_LLM_API_KEY` under
`engine.env` (auto-detection only covers the in-cluster LiteLLM master key). For the NemoClaw agent,
set `litellm.baseUrl` to the same endpoint — the chart accepts any OpenAI-compatible URL.

### Why both a FastAPI engine *and* an OpenClaw agent?

They are deliberately separated because an LLM agent is **not** a trustworthy system of record:

- **FastAPI = the bank's compliance system.** It is deterministic and unit-testable. It owns
  state, identity (analyst vs. approver JWT), the **policy gate** (`amount ≥ $5M OR KYC
  pending`), the **gated submit** (the memo cannot be published until an approval is recorded),
  the **audit trail**, and all human integration (portal, console, emails, official archive).
- **OpenClaw = the analyst's brain.** It is the visible "agentic" step — it reasons over the
  collected data and writes the memo. It is a *pluggable backend* for the drafting step
  (`SLVD_AGENT_BACKEND = openclaw | direct_llm | stub`); swap it and the entire governance
  layer is unchanged.
- **The agent cannot bypass control.** The submit tool is gated *server-side* in the MCP, and
  the agent's draft is *validated* (format + required values) before it proceeds. So no matter
  what the model wants to do, the memo only publishes after a human approval is recorded.

The demo's core point: **governed, human-in-the-loop AI** — the AI prepares the work, the
deterministic engine enforces policy, the human makes the call.

### The governed MCP tools

| Order | Tool | Returns | Access |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `get_crm_profile` | client profile, industry, BO status | read, per-case auth |
| 2 | `get_credit_exposure` | facility, limit, utilization, risk rating | read, per-case auth |
| 3 | `get_transactions` | transaction / cash-flow behavior | read, per-case auth |
| 4 | `get_compliance_status` | KYC status, sanctions | read, per-case auth |
| 5 | `get_prior_memo` | prior conditions, open follow-ups | read, per-case auth |
| 6 | `workflow__submit_credit_memo` | submits the memo into the workflow | **gated — needs approval** |

The agent calls all five read tools (safe), drafts the memo, then calls the gated submit.

> **Model note — use an agent model with native tool calling.** The agent drives the governed
> MCP through multi-turn tool calls, so the model must support **tool/function calling**
> reliably. A **~20B+ parameter** model is recommended for correct tool calling — smaller
> models tend to drop or malform tool calls and break the agent loop.

## Deployment (HPE Private Cloud AI)

The demo is deployed by **importing the framework through the PCAI platform UI**.
The UI does the install:
Upload the chart via the UI wizard and applies the values you enter in the form.

### Prerequisite — import the NemoClaw (agent) chart first

The SLVD engine drives the agent through the **NemoClaw / OpenClaw gateway**, so the
NemoClaw chart must be deployed **before** the SLVD chart (the engine connects to it via
`SLVD_OPENCLAW_URL`). It is shipped in this repo:

- Chart source: `charts/nemoclaw/` (Helm chart, icon at `nemoclaw/icon.png`)
- Packaged: `nemoclaw-0.2.11.tgz` (repo root)
- Skills: the chart ships `files/skills/bank-credit/SKILL.md` and seeds it into
  the agent state dir at every pod start — the OpenClaw agent runs headless, so
  without this the `bank-credit` skill is missing and memo drafting degrades.
- Icon: `nemoclaw-icon.png` (repo root — used as the UI app-tile logo)

Push it to chartmuseum, then in the PCAI UI: Frameworks → *Import framework* →
select the `nemoclaw` chart → fill in values (`ezua.virtualService.endpoint` with
`${DOMAIN_NAME}`, the LLM endpoint `litellm.baseUrl` + `litellm.model` + `litellm.apiKey`
(API key is entered directly in the values form), `gateway.token`) → *Deploy*.
This creates the `nemoclaw` namespace + the OpenClaw gateway service that SLVD targets.

### Deploy the SLVD chart

1. **Import in the PCAI UI**: Frameworks → *Import framework* (BYOA) → select the
   `slvd` chart version from chartmuseum → upload `slvd-icon.png` as the app-tile
   logo → fill in the values:
   - image tag (from step 1) and `${DOMAIN_NAME}` for the ingress host
   - the `secrets:` block no longer exists — the form can be **left empty**
     (zero-input deploy). Backend credentials now live under `engine.env`
     and are emitted only for the configured `SLVD_AGENT_BACKEND`:
     `SLVD_LLM_API_KEY` (backend=`direct_llm`, auto-detected from the
     in-cluster litellm master-key Secret when empty) and
     `SLVD_OPENCLAW_TOKEN` (backend=`openclaw`, auto-detected from the
     NemoClaw gateway ConfigMap when empty). Signing keys
     (`SLVD_JWT_SECRET`/`SLVD_HMAC_SECRET`/`SLVD_MCP_INTERNAL_TOKEN`) are
     generated deterministically from the release coordinates. Any non-empty
     `engine.env` value you enter always overrides auto-detection.
   - agent/LLM endpoints (`SLVD_OPENCLAW_URL`, `SLVD_LLM_BASE_URL`) are
     auto-detected from the in-cluster NemoClaw / LiteLLM services when those
     apps are deployed first; the values.yaml entries are fallbacks only.

   → *Deploy*. The platform creates the namespace and the release.


- **External URLs**: an Istio VirtualService on the platform ingress gateway
  (`istio-system/ezaf-gateway`) exposes
  - Portal: `https://slvd.${DOMAIN_NAME}`
  - Mail:   `https://slvd-mail.${DOMAIN_NAME}`
- **Pods**: exactly 4 (1 per component) — portal, engine, credit-memo-mcp, mailpit.
- **Agent backend**: `SLVD_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw` → the NemoClaw gateway service.
- **LLM**: `SLVD_LLM_MODEL` via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`SLVD_LLM_BASE_URL`) — the in-cluster LiteLLM proxy **or** an MLIS-served model.
